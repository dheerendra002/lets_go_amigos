 It allows friends going on a trip to better plan their trip. Since a lot of times, 
 the starting point of many person in a group isn't the same, people have to get together 
 on a starting point and then proceed from their on. This is a waste of money as well as fuel.
 This hack, given the starting points and the destination, decides which path to take from each of
 the starting points to the destination, which allows the persons to forego the ordeal of meeting up at
 a point before starting the journey. This saves the time as well as gives some flexibility when and where to
 start for a journey
